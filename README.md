### BMI Calculator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements:
1. Weight(kg)

2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/ (Height * Height)

We will use BMI to determine whether whther a user is underweight, obese or normal.



### BMI	Weight Status
Below 18.5	Underweight /n
18.5—24.9	Healthy Weight /n
25.0—29.9	Overweight /n
30.0-34.9   obese /n
35.0-39.9    Severely obese /n
above 39.9          Morbidily Obese /n
